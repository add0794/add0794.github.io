# Hello, I'm Alex!

I'm a data analyst that will help you and/or your organization make well-informed decisions by efficiently and effectively making sense of your data. Originally trained as a sustainability consultant, I've self-taught Python, SQL, Tableau, R, Git, and Linux. I am, additionally, a Certified Scrum Master (CSM) and Data Analyst Associate and Data Analyst Professional by Data Camp.

I regularly complete independent projects using Excel, Python, SQL, or Tableau (or a mix), all of which are below. I [blog](https://furry-date-ae4.notion.site/Rethinking-Circular-Economy-34b44ede819c49158d207ac18607e85d) regularly and invite you to learn about "circular economy!"
