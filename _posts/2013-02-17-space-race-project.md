There is a a rich dataset on the history of space missions from [Next Space Flight](nextspaceflight.com) that's just waiting to be analyzed and visualized. What organizations launch missions? When? How much does it cost?

Laid forth by 100 Days of Code Bootcamp on Udemy, I answered 4 essential questions:

- Who launched the most missions in any given year?
- How has the cost of a space mission varied over time?
- Which months are the most popular for launches?
- Have space missions gotten safer or has the chance of failure remained unchanged?

Find answers to these questions and learn how I did so by accessing the project [here](https://github.com/add0794/space_race/blob/8a1ebe36f9c88862b1bd0f89841e1685f2bf2cf5/README.md).

<h2>FAQ:</h2>

- What programming language did you use? **Excel**
- Why did you do this project? **I wanted to challenge myself as I complete Udemy's 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.**
- What do you think you did well? **Excel offers many of the same tools that its peers do, though executing is simply different. I navigated that with ease as I made new worksheets for each question.**
- What's the most important lesson you learned? **Excel is often as good as programming languages, and data analysts need to use it as often, if not more so, than programming languages. There is not always a need to use Python, R, Tableau, or SQL.**
- If you did this project again, what would you do differently? **When using Excel, use as many sheets necessary to answer questions and track progress, especially because Git is not an option. I am so used to Python's (Jupyter) Notebooks, so I did a poor job of writing code that I had to go back and rewrite everything. Do not waste time on such antics.**
