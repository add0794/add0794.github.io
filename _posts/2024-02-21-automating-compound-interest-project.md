Excel is helpful for calculating compound interest, but it's often not enough. Automate the [process](https://github.com/add0794/compare-compound-interest/tree/main) with Python simply by answering a few questions and getting the results within **milliseconds**.

- What programming language did you use? **Python**
- Why did you do this project? **I wanted to make life easier. We are so attuned to using Excel for financial analysis, but why? Python offers the same capabilities, quite often faster, using less memory, and for free. For those making sense of their personal finances, this will make compound interest fairly easy and straightforward.**
- What do you think you did well? **I measured how long automating compound interest takes using a built-in Python library.**
- What's the most important lesson you learned? **JSON is your best friend, so create JSON files to store data.**
- If you did this project again, what would you do differently? **I would've connected the program to Excel for those who want to save their output to a spreadsheet rather than a NumPy array.**
