Quickly get your age [calculated](https://github.com/add0794/age-calculator) where you simply enter your date of birth.

- What programming language did you use? **HTML and JavaScript/TypeScript (JS)**
- Why did you do this project? **I wanted to try something different. I'm so used to Python that I need to learn how other programming languages work. JavaScript is a great opportunity because of its web development, concurrency (e.g. asynchronous, parallelism), and API fetching. While I've already learning JS, I wanted to try a basic project.**
- What do you think you did well? **I got the project done right and incorporated TypeScript, too, for error handling.**
- What's the most important lesson you learned? **CSS is not always necessary, though I will need to continue adding styling for future project.**
- If you did this project again, what would you do differently? **I would've added Bootstrap or Tailwind to help me with styling!**
