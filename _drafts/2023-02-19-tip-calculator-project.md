Simply [calculate](https://github.com/add0794/tip-calculator) your tip and bill amount in dollars calculated when you enter a percentage value that you usually use for tipping.

- What programming language did you use? **HTML and JavaScript/TypeScript (JS)**
- Why did you do this project? **As with the Age Calculator, I wanted to try something different. JavaScript is so necessary, whether I do or don't use web development, because having another perspective on software programming will help me in learning new languages or improving coding skills. I wanted to try a basic project.**
- What do you think you did well? **I got the project done right and incorporated TypeScript, too, for error handling.**
- What's the most important lesson you learned? **As with the Age Calculator, CSS is not always necessary, though I will need to continue adding styling for future project.**
- If you did this project again, what would you do differently? **I would've added Bootstrap or Tailwind to help me with styling!**
