This [program](https://github.com/add0794/url-parsing/tree/main) processes the x- and y-coordinates associated with each character in a table, then creates a grid of those characters based on their x- and y-coordinates.

- What programming language did you use? **Python**
- Why did you do this project? **I wanted to create a program that sends messages back and forth between two or more persons.**
- What do you think you did well? **I created a grid using the x- and y-coordinates, which I've never done before.**
- What's the most important lesson you learned? **I learned how a computer interprets how the two axes increase and decrease. Surprisingly, the x-axis increases as you move to the right while the y-axis increases as you move downward. I did not previously know that.**
- If you did this project again, what would you do differently? **I would've made the code more concise. Rather than start with a NumPy array, I started with a list. I could've started with a NumPy array and zipped the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and characters as tuples in an array that would've reduced memory storage significantly.**
