# Hello, I'm Alex!

## Who Am I?

I'm your typical nerdy data scientist guiding organizations make sense of their data to make well-informed decisions. 

I didnâ€™t start with data science. In fact, I wanted to be an industrial-organizational (IO) psychologist, and my masters is in sustainability management from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/. (I studied environmental science at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/)). 

I stayed away from programming until graduate school when I learned R. That moment on, I fell in love with IDEs, the command line, git, and all that software development entailed.

## Highlights:

- Developed recommendations for the [Trust for Governors Island](https://www.govisland.com/about/the-trust-for-governors-island) by analyzing results on Excel of a waste audit conducted in 2018.
- Published a 7-page [report](https://reports.aashe.org/institutions/stevens-institute-of-technology-nj/report/2020-03-02/AC/curriculum/AC-6/) for the Facilities department of Stevens Institute of Technology analyzing results of a survey, recommending best practices for educating students on environmental sustainability in 2020.
- Published a 10-page report profiling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of [Dairy Farmers of America (DFA)](https://www.dfamilk.com/), highlighting prominent sources and showing viability of achieving target by using R and Markdown in 2020.
- Visualized for professors how well students incorporate sustainability into their capstone design projects, alongside their final grades, by using R and Markdown and presented results at a [peer conference](https://strategy.asee.org/assessing-the-sustainability-components-of-engineering-capstone-projects) in 2021.

I make software and data projects for fun, too. Those can be found in [Projects](projects.md)

## Anything Else?

I love to bike, learn, volunteer, swim, spend time with friends...all of the nerdy stuff you'd expect from someone who likes to play on his computer. I also [blog](https://furry-date-ae4.notion.site/Rethinking-Circular-Economy-34b44ede819c49158d207ac18607e85d) regularly: on civic issues, reducing food waste, recycling, startups, and so much more. Whatever crosses my mind and I have an insight, I write about it.
