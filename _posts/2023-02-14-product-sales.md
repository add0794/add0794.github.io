Pens and Partners is launching a new product line and must identify which sales tactics work effectively. Your job is to lead the company forward by analyzing the retailer's [data](https://github.com/add0794/product_sales_analysis/blob/f85af366447686c8ff2b724e8aafee580a3c8707/product_sales.csv).

Laid forth by Data Camp in its practical examination for the Data Analyst Associate certificate, I answered 3 essential questions:

- How many customers were there for each approach?
- What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?
- Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
- Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use? Some of these methods take more time from the team so they may not be the best for us to use if the results are similar.


Find answers to these questions and learn how I did so by accessing the project [here](https://github.com/add0794/product_sales_analysis/blob/f85af366447686c8ff2b724e8aafee580a3c8707/README.md).

<h2>FAQ:</h2>

- What programming language did you use? **Python**
- Why did you do this project? **Practical examination for DataCamp's Data Analyst Professional certificate.**
- What do you think you did well? **Data analysis is as much a business role. I stepped into the *Recommendations* section with ease and developed useful metrics, with recommendations that made use of those metrics.**
- What's the most important lesson you learned? **Do not make conclusions based on a few graphs. Dig deeper to find hidden about the data.**
- If you did this project again, what would you do differently? **Use helper modules and write the functions as methods! Using a Python (Jupyter) Notebook is immensely helpful, but the code can get messy quickly. Keep the Notebook tidy by writing the functions elsewhere.**
