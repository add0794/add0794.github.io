This project visualizes and analyzes common space race questions by accessing a rich dataset from [Next Space Flight](nextspaceflight.com). Rather than use Python, I use advanced Excel functions to navigate those answers.

Project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/add0794/space_race/blob/8a1ebe36f9c88862b1bd0f89841e1685f2bf2cf5/README.md).
